# Javascript-Bootstrap-Assignment

The assignment emphasizes practice using Bootstrapâ€™s JavaScript components and solving programming problems with JavaScript. I have created a web application with a single HTML file named 'index.html', a JavaScript file 'website.js', and an CSS file. The task involves modifying sample code from Bootstrap components, I had chosen to exlude the Carousel component, and use a different style.

I have chosen to style this website neatly and professionally. Every section of my chosen Bootstrap component contains an input element and a readonly textarea for output, all with unique IDs for easy JavaScript handling. I have writen functions in JavaScript to solve problems from three groups: basic numerical checks and conversions, string and integer manipulations without using advanced methods, and either binary string interpretation or simple equation evaluation.

I achieved 100% on this assignment.
